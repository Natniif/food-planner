## Food prep helper

This is a small program used by me to help plan my meals :)

Use the sample json file to help you plan your meals for the week
If you run the following program

```
python3 plan.py
```

The program will output the Food required for the week and also the calorie and macro breakdown.

I have included some recipes but if you want the program to extend you need to input the ingredients and macro values same as in the other json files.

### Testing

Run tests with `pytest`.
